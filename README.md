# Random-quote-machine
random quote machine is an react app that generate random quotes each time you click on the "new quote" button. this app uses React hooks, `useState` to manage states such as quotes, loading, error. And colors, which changes on every click. as well the `useEffect` to fetch the data on the first render.
uses of framer motion to add some animation at the first render and also for button. You can also tweet the quotes you like !!
